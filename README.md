# SortVisualizer
A collection of small visualizations to demonstrate various sort algorithms.

And an experiment in building some sort of animation toolkit for visualizing this kind of thing - far from complete though.

So far a single sort algorithm has been implemented, with two variations: Insertion sort with shifting and swapping.
